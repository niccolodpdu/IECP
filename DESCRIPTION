Title: Iterative equilibration of cell-type asymmetry
Version: 0.0.1.0
Description: Cell-type asymmetry in expression profiles can substantially impact the outcomes of reference-free deconvolution. To address this, we proposed ITEA which aims to enhance the accuracy of proportion inference under the influence of cell-type asymmetry. ITEA iteratively identifies Consistently Expressed Genes (CEGs) across the cell-type expression profiles in S after each round of deconvolution and uses these CEGs to normalize the bulk expression matrix X.
